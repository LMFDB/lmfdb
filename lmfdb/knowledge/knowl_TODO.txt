TASKS:
* Modify schema as described below
* Modify knowl code to create new entry when saving rather than updating and adding to history
* Change knowl display code to use `SELECT DISTINCT ON id FROM kwl_knowls WHERE status != 'deleted' ORDER BY timestamp DESC` rather than `lucky`
* Implement renaming: change the id for all instances in the table
* Make links column update when saving knowl
* Search with wildcards (use tilde operator and a checkbox on the search; think about details)
* Update quality restrictions on search to use status rather than quality
* Switch lock mechanism to use the new lock table.  Ignore old locks rather than deleting them
* Add autosaves by updating an inprogress knowl record
* Add a list of locks at the top of the knowl browse page which show your locks and give you links to delete the lock or start editing again
* Automatically fill in type if ends in .top or .bottom
* Add filter for showing top/bottom knowls when searching (off by default).  Never show comments knowls in main list.
* For annotations, add link back to object from display page (not when displayed as part of homepage)
* For knowls that have quality 'reviewed', check to see which should have status 1
* Add ability to view history and revert to old version
* Add ability to view diffs against old versions when editing knowl
* Delete kwl_history and kwl_deleted tables
* Update scripts that copy knowls to production
* Add column to userdb.users for knowl reviewing privledges, add review function at the bottom of the knowl view page (rather than having to explicitly edit), which should update reviewer, review_timestamp and status
* Comments knowl, id given by appending `.comments`, versioned as a normal know.  Will only show up if logged in.  Editable from the page for main knowl
* Add ability to search for knowls with comments

SCHEMA MODIFICATIONS:
* Delete history column
* Rename to kwl_knowls2 and port existing data
* Fill in links for existing knowls
* Fill in source column for existing annotation knowls

TODO:
- genus 0 corner cases
- hyperelliptic RR
- hyperelliptic Newton
- deg 7, g=2,3
- show automorphism group on lmfdb page for galmaps
- display coeffs for map, phi = (a0xy+a1xy^2+...)/(b0+b1x+...) where a0=... etc
- database of passports even if the maps are not computed
- incorporate Bailey's drawing software

It would be nice if:
- sort a,b,c
- we use dots instead of dashes in the labels
- we display the full S_3-action of maps (including the data when these are the same, and a map is isomorphic to one of its pullbacks under an element of S_3), including 1/phi, ...
- we display the genus of the Galois closure and its ramification type; and then to link this with the curves with "many automorphisms"
- we label arithmetic maps, and when they are congruence
- we identify the (non)congruence subgroup of SL_2(ZZ) or Gamma(2) it corresponds to
- maps with triangle groups mapping to other triangle groups are separately identified (and easy to browse)
- compute and identify fiber products and imprimitive maps
- when F=QQ, use polyring over QQ not QQ(nu)
- Friends
- embeddings in binary
- factorization of phi (or divisor)
- tripleredabs?
- display info about group
- download curve/map in magma then in sage and/or pari

Soon:
- Upload the rest of our data
- Improve the pages under "Learn more about" and add a reliability page
- see statistics on base field data
- browsing and searching on passports in general? adding passport knowl on main browse page
- degs and gs: change column names in db?
- fix breadcrumbs (top of galmap pages)
- record arithmetic part (constant field extension) of function field extension given by Belyi map

Short term:
- add friends: specialize map and connect to resulting number fields? specialize at values in list of j-invariants with good reduction outside of 2 and 3?
- improve display of equations; table of coeffs? Polredfunctionfieldabs?
- Compute L-functions of curves, if possible
- show automorphism group on lmfdb page for galmaps

Long term:
- pictures of dessins: Mike's ribbon graphs?; Bailey's drawing software (keeping the action of complex conjugation and other evident symmetries)?
- allow passports without all maps computed
- compute and identify fiber products and imprimitive maps
- add friends: links to HGMs?
- database of passports even if the maps are not computed
- make input file modular enough to accept data from all sources (allowing pages with partial info)
- incorporate David Roberts's and Noam's data into the database; will probably require rewriting infrastructure
- allow multiple versions of the same map, and show the relevant automorphism when available
- genus 0 corner cases
- hyperelliptic Newton
- deg 7, g=2,3

It would be nice if:
- sort a,b,c
- display the full S_3-action of maps (including the data when these are the same, and a map is isomorphic to one of its pullbacks under an element of S_3), including 1/phi, ...
- display the genus of the Galois closure and its ramification type; and then to link this with the curves with "many automorphisms"
- label arithmetic maps, and when they are congruence
- identify the (non)congruence subgroup of SL_2(ZZ) or Gamma(2) it corresponds to
- maps with triangle groups mapping to other triangle groups are separately identified (and easy to browse)
- compute and identify fiber products and imprimitive maps
- when F=QQ, use polyring over QQ not QQ(nu)
- Friends: HGMs, specializations of number fields, genus 1 and 2 curves
- Give descent of lax Belyi map when available
- renamed "abc triple" to something less triggering
- make links direct to passport pages (and search on them)
- add annotations?
- embeddings in binary?
- factorization of phi (or divisor)
- display info about group
- compute Galois group over K(t)
- larger interactive conformal picture of fundamental domain with HTML regions over labels that display side-pairing elements

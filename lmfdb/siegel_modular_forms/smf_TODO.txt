* Ensure weight (2,0) gives all dimensions equal to zero.  (Should be automatic when newspaces table is regenerated.)
* Fix breadcrumbs for Siegel spaces
* Weight search with vectors doesn't work, e.g. the browse (9,2)-(16,2) gives 
   Query was: {'weight': {'$gte': '{9,2}', '$lte': '{16,2}'}}
but that is interpreted in a lexicographic way.  Is that what we want?
* Add char_parity to newspaces

# This script links the nfgal database of Tim Dokchitser's data to the other number field database
# It works by computing the polredabs of a defining polynomial of the field, and looking it up in the other number field database
# (Admittedly, often the defining polynomial is already polredabs'd)
# If that canonical form is in the number field database, this scripts adds a "label" field in Tim's database
# If not, it does nothing

# This could be improved by working in two passes: one to compute the polredabs and store it, one to link to the other database. 
# This would be at the expense of further deviating from Tim's original data submission

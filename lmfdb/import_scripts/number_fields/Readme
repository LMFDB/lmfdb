The import script can be run by

  sage -python import_nf_data.py list of files to import

Each file should consist of a single list of fields.  The format is
described in the import script.  The file prep.gp can be used with
pari to generate a file in the correct format.  In gp,

\r prep.gp
all = doall([list of polynomials])
write("myoutputfile", all)

Then myoutputfile can be imported as above.  The gp script will only
work for polynomials of degree <12 because pari can only compute Galois
groups in this range.

After renaming database to fields, 

  create_random_object_index(nf, "fields")

after loading jj.py

CRITICAL (BUGS):
* make all tests pass (Edgar)
* knowls: reliability, cande, source in the new paradigm (Drew)
* Update downloads for coefficients, trace form, magma to handle spare cyclotomic rep (Edgar, JV)
* Update download q-expansion links to handle cyclotomic representation, e.g. http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/download_qexp/3636.1.br.a. (Edgar)
* Once the item above is addressed, update magma download links to also handle cyclotomic representation. (Edgar)
* Include ap in the downloads, with a make_an snippet.  Afterward, check that http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/download_qexp/11.2.a.a has at least 1000 an. (Edgar)
* change references to mf.sturm_bound to use mf.elliptic.sturm_bound (and in general, we should be using mf.elliptic knowls unless the knowl really applies to modular forms in greater generality)

IMPORTANT:
* Prove image types for all weight one forms (Drew)
* Compute L-functions for weight-1 and forms of trivial character past Nk^2 > 4000 (Edgar)
 - Forms of weight 1 and level in [1001,4000] (ongoing at saint-germain)
 - Forms of weight \in [2, 15], trivial character, with Nk^2 in:
    # [4001,10000]  ready for upload
    # [10001,20000] (missing 44)
    # [20001,40000] (ongoing @zeus.lmfdb.xyz)
 - Forms of weight >= 16, trivial character, with Nk^2 in [4001,10000], [10001,20000], [20001,40000]
* Compare trivial char data with Stein database (Drew)
* Write and run validation procedure to verify modular form data after it has been uploaded to postgres.  Figure out how to incorporate this into our long term workflow. (Drew)
* Once the RCS knowls are written, adjust the wording at the top of the statistics page to make it clearer what is included in the stats and include explicit links to completeness and rigor knowls.

FINAL CHECKS:
* Make sure indexes are appropriate (Edgar)

-------------------------- Pull Request Line -------------------------------------------------
* add a link to top of stats for dynamic
* allow to customize from main stats
* add constrains for the traces in dynamic stats
* Add trace tables for newspaces once trace forms are present (David)
* Add newspace portraits for all newspaces where we have the trace form (Drew)
* code snippets for form and space pages in Sage and Pari.
* Work on spacing between coefficients and variables in web_latex_poly: lmfdb/utils.py
* Lift projective reps for weight one forms to artin reps whereever possible (Drew)
* add ECQD and genus 2 curves to friends (Edgar)
* add L-functions instances for Artin rep (Edgar)
* Speed up Dirichlet character search (currently doing a ton of lookup and lucky calls rather than using search() (David LD)
* avoid access exclusive lock with the alter table when using copy from
* Compute completions at global fields (primes dividing level), compute decomposition groups, embeddings (David)
* Consider displaying the disriminant of coefficient ring on newform pages when field discriminant is known (this is just the product of the index and the field discriminant)
* Add completeness table and metadata in order to make claims about provability
* checklist is broken

CRITICAL DB:
* on a delete, if restat fails on a delete command it still commits the delete command

KNOWL FEATURES: (March)
* Revision history and reversion (all versions stored in kwl_knowls table)
* Multiple versions for beta and prod (needs a review status column)
* Status column (smallint): reviewed, beta, deleted
* Renaming: change the id on every knowl (no history)
* jsonb row with links to other knowls
* search with wildcards
* View all knowls: SELECT DISTINCT ON id FROM kwl_knowls WHERE status != 'deleted' ORDER BY timestamp DESC
* Edit locks (prevent editing if locked, get own locks): new table with (id, timestamp, username)
* Label as annotation (column: boolean? or type?) automatically mark as such if navigated from a top knowl link (use .top and .bottom convention)
* Link back to object from annotations (another field which is a link back to object)
* Viewable diffs (on the fly)
* Do we care about porting data from kwl_history table? No.
* Add column to user table giving power to review knowls
* Comments: anyone can leave a comment.  Anyone can search for knowls with comments.
* Add reviewer column to knowl table; update edit interface.  Do we want reviewing to create a new copy of the knowl, or edit most recent copy?  If second, should have a review timestamp.
* Use KNOWL_INC more....
* Preserve author history

COLLABORATION SUGGESTIONS:
* Forms that have no zeros except at the cusps
* Protocol buffers

GOOD:
* col_type is cached add to FAQ
* self-twist sometimes wraps
* move the constant coefficient in q-exp coefficients to the left
* merge L-function data of G2C, EC, ECNF with CMF using trace_hash
* Reduce clutter in the url (cleanSubmit doesn't seem to be getting everything)
* Update Fricke eigenvalue to sign of the functional equation (after figuring out where this makes sense)
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)

FORMATTING:
* Consider switching level and weight on browse and refine search input boxes

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* search on character degree?
* it would be nice if, if hecke field is cyclotomic don't use \zeta_3
* show AL dimensions for old forms as well as new
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* What about putting in "nice latex" for q-exp when available, e.g. if beta_i = nu^i and nu has a nice rep (like sqrt{N} or zeta_n)?
* form pages: provide downloads of q-expansions for Magma/pari
* Saved queries for demos (cf checklist)

FUTURE WORK:
* data: for spaces where we do not compute an algebraic q-expansion, still give the first few Hecke polynomials
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: add trace hash for ECNF L-fun
* data: make friends with base changes of HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal
* Improve modular form plots

NOT CMF STUFF:
* reset start with javascript
* generalize search_types
* hidden != search clean hidden
* add utf8 check to pyflakes
* pick columns and sort order on search results
* add UIs to pick random objects with contraints
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!
* fix hmf and bmf l-functions
* Shrink the sidebar with a button analogous to the properties shrinker
* Related fields for dirichlet characters that are Kronecker symbols
* Change color of input/select elements if they're actively constraining a search (easy to forget that you've constrained something)

TO THINK ABOUT:
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)

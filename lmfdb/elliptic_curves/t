Class of size 2, either curve may be optimal:

http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/300006b1/
http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/300006b2/

3 curves in class, any of the first 3 may be optimal, the 4th is not.
All Manin constants are conditional on the first curve being optimal:

http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/499992a2/
http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/499992a3/
http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/499992a4/

2 curves in class, N>260000 but we know which is optimal:

http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/300003a1/
http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/300003a2/

2 curves in class, the second has Manin constant 2:

http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/104393a1/
http://localhost:37777/EllipticCurve/Q/104393a2/

The rogue class 990 where curve 99h3 is optial (LMFDB class label 990.i with 990.i3 optimal):

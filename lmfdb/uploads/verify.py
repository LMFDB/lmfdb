"""
This script is used to perform additional verification on uploads before review by a human editor.  Simple verifications are performed when an LMFDB user uploads data, but additional verification (anything requiring a nontrivial amount of computation for example) are performed by this script.  It is intended for use by a cron job, and is called with no arguments.

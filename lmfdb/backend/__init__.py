"""
This module provides an interface to Postgres supporting
the kinds of queries needed by the LMFDB.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from lmfdb import db
    sage: db
    Interface to Postgres database
    sage: len(db.tablenames)
    53
    sage: db.tablenames[0]
    'artin_field_data'
    sage: db.artin_field_data
    Interface to Postgres table artin_field_data

You can search using the methods ``search``, ``lucky`` and ``lookup``::

    sage: G = db.gps_groups.lookup('8.2')
    sage: G['exponent']
    4

- ``extra_table`` -- a string or None.  If provided, gives the name of a table that is linked to the search table by an ``id`` column and provides more data that cannot be searched on.  The reason to separate the data into two tables is to reduce the size of the search table.  For large tables this speeds up some queries.
- ``count_table`` -- a string or None.  If provided, gives the name of a table that caches counts for searches on the search table.  These counts are relevant when many results are returned, allowing the search pages to report the number of records even when it would take Postgres a long time to compute this count.

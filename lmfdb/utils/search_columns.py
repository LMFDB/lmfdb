"""
This file includes classes defining how the columns on search result pages display,
as well as how they create content in a downloaded file.  There are two kinds of classes:

* Instances of ``SearchCol`` (and its subclasses), correspond to a single column, defining
  how it is displayed and downloaded
* All of the search columns are collected into a ``SearchColumns`` instance, providing an
  interface for interacting with the set of columns as a whole.

The three main entry points to ``SearchCol`` are

* its ``display`` method, which returns a string to be displayed in the html corresponding to
  the column within a row corresponding to a provided dictionary,
* its ``download`` method, which returns a Python object that is then encoded using a download
  language (in ``lmfdb/utils/downloader.py``) when creating a download file,
* its ``show`` method, which is used to iterate over columns, and usually just yields the
  column, but can yield nothing (if the column shouldn't be displayed) or multiple subcolumns
  (in the case of column groups).

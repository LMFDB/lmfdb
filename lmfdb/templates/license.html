<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

<h4>Is mathematical data really copyrightable?</h4>

<p>Indeed, the individual elements of a dataset of mathematical objects are not copyrightable.  However, most jurisdictions provide for copyright on a the collection as a whole.  For example,</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/legal-protection-databases.html">European Union</a>, "a database will be protected by copyright if the selection or arrangement of its contents constitute the creator's own intellectual creation."</li>
  <li>In the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/reports/appendix.pdf">United States</a>, databases are protected when "formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship."</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we believe that <a href="https://beta.lmfdb.org/rcs">completeness claims</a> are protected under these clauses, as are search results for queries.  Individual facts about L-functions, modular forms, curves or fields are not.  Of course, we encourage you to <a href="{{url_for('citation')}}">cite us</a> whenever you use the LMFDB!</p>

<h4>How should I provide attribution?</h4>

<p>There are details available on our <a href="{{url_for('citation')}}">citation</a> page.</p>

<h4>How does this apply to training an AI model using this data?</h4>

<p>See <a href="https://creativecommons.org/using-cc-licensed-works-for-ai-training-2/">this guidance</a> from Creative Commons.  We also encourage you to use more efficient <a href="{{url_for('API.options')}}">access options</a> rather than scraping the website directly, and to rate limit your website requests in order to not overload our servers.</p>

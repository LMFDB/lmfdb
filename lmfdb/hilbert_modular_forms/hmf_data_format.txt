line 1: starts with "COEFFS := "
        e.g. COEFFS := [ -1, -1, 1 ];
        defines list of coefficients of minimal polynomial

line 2: starts with "n := "
        e.g. n := 2
        degree

line 3: starts with "d := "
        e.g. n := 5
        discriminant

line 4: is "F<w> := NumberField(Polynomial(COEFFS));"
        creates the field in Magma

line 5: starts with "PRIMES := "
        followed by a list of triples representing prime ideals P,
        each of the form [N, n, alpha] where N=N(P), n the smallest
        positive integer in P and alpha a second generator as a
        polynomial in w.

line 6: is "PRIMES1 := [];"

line 7: starts with "LEVEL := "
        followed by a list of triples representing ideals I,
        each of the form [N, n, alpha] where N=N(I), n the smallest
        positive integer in I and alpha a second generator as a
        polynomial in w.

line 8: is "LEVELS1 := [];"

line 9: is "NEWFORMS := [*"

lines 10ff: each contains one newform, the format is either

      <level, label, aplist>

      where: level is a triple representing the ideal, e.g. [31, 31, w + 12]
             label is a string, e.g. "a"
             aplist is a list of integers

      or (for non-rational newforms)


      <level, label, poly, aplist>

      where: level is a triple representing the ideal, e.g. [31, 31, w + 12]
             label is a string, e.g. "a"
             poly is a polynomial in x, e.g. x^2 + 2*x - 4
             aplist is a list of polynomials in e

             where the Hecke eigenvalue field is Q(e)=Q[x]/poly.

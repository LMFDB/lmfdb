Revides format of data in files which are imported
==========================================

The first three lines define the field and related data.  Each
subsequent line defines a single newform.  We could use separate files
for the field information and newforms information, in which case I
would want each newform line to contain some identifier for the field
(label or coeffs), since I would like to file's content to be
self-contained and not to rely on the filename itself.

line 1: COEFFS <int-list>

        e.g. COEFFS [-1,-1,1]

        list of integer coefficients of minimal polynomial, no
        embedded spaces, starting with the constant term and ending
        with a 1 since monic.

line 2: PRIMES <ideal-triple-list>

        where ideal-triple := [int,int,<int-list>]

        where the first entry is the norm, the second the least positive
        integer, and the third is the list of coefficients of a second
        generator of the ideal with respect to the power basis.  This
        defines the fixed ordering of the prime ideals, which will be
        by order of norm but the order of primes of the same norm will
        be fixed by this list.  Norms up to 1000.

line 3: LEVELS <ideal-triple-list>

        As for PRIMES but for all integral ideals.  Norms up to ?

lines 4ff: each contains one newform, the format is either short (for
rational eigenvalues) or long (for non-rational)

Short form: 4 space-separated fields per line, with no embedded spaces:

      level-label level label aplist

      where:
           @ level-label is norm.index (e.g. 31.1)
           @ level is a triple as in LEVELS
           @ label is a string of 1 or more lower case letters
                      representing positive integsr in base 26
           @ aplist is a list of integers, one for each prime in the
                      PRIMES list (in that order, but not necessarily
                      as many primes).

Long form (for non-rational newforms)

     level-label level label hcoeffs aplist


     where: @ level-label, level , label are as before;

            @ hcoeffs is a listof the coeffs of the polynomial
                      defining the Hecke eigenvalue field

            @ aplist is a list of rational-lists, each giving the
                      coefficients of one Hecke eigenvalue with
                      respect to a power basis for the Hecke
                      eigenvalue field.

Guidelines
----------

1. Each mathematical object should have its own home page.  Home pages
summarize basic invariants at the top, progressing to more advanced
information at the bottom, with mathematical terms defined by knowls.
The right hand side of each home page should include a properties box
that summarizes key invariants, links to completeness, source, and
reliability knowls, and when applicable, a list of related objects.
2. Each home page should have a mathematically meaningful, permanent URL.
3. Each mathematical object should be given a label that is mathematically
meaningful, and to the extent possible, human-readable and concise.
The translation between an object's label and its URL should be
relatively straightforward.
4. Each home page should list the names of the entities responsible
for producing the data on that page.
5. Each class of objects has a browse-and-search page, which has
browsing options in the upper portion of the page, and a search form
below.  It should be possible to browse to the home page of an
object without having detailed knowledge about the underlying
mathematics.  The search form should be (at least partially) visible
in a browser without scrolling the browse-and-search page.
6. Home pages and browse-and-search pages should address the needs
of both experts and non-experts in the subject, in order to ensure
that the pages are useful to a broad mathematical audience.

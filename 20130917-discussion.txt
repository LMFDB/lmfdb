Want for L functions:
    - Z plots
    - first few zeroes
    - special values
    - root number
    - coefficients

Algorithms for computing general L functions rigorously to high precision:
    A (guessing bad factors)
    B one L, one s \in CC (lcalc)
    C one L, many s on the critical line
    D one s\in CC, many L in a family (cf Dave Platt, Andy is thinking of this first for Dirichlet, then cusp forms)
    E certficiation of non-algebraic modular forms
    F Fourier interpolation (compute a bunch of values along grid, Fourier because L functions are band limited, explicit formula has a range in the sum)
    
Mostly interested in s of small heights, in this order:
    1 Dirichlet L functions
    2 Holomorphic modular forms of low integral weight, or of low level
    3 Artin representations
    4 Hecke characters
    5 Hypergeometric motives
    
3, 4, 5 might benefit from C the most
For 1 and 2, D is maybe most relevant

Data/backend:

- Add Gamma1(N) and Gamma(N) when the computations work
- Increase range of surfaces?
- Add cusps and elliptic points for the GL, Gamma0 surfaces
- Add indexes to fix slow queries?

HMSurfaces home page:

- As for modular curves, add text "the database currently contains..."
- Make statistics
- Reliability: as for modular curves, write "this is an alpha version subject to change..."
- Replace "Modular curve labels" by "Hilbert modular surface labels" and explain labels
- Populate: source and acknowledgements, Completeness of data, Hilbert modular surface labels

Browse section:

- by family, by level, by holomorphic Euler characteristic, by Kodaira dimension
- Interesting HMS (from VDG?)
- Random Hilbert modular surface

Knowls:

- Field / discriminant
- Class number
- Norm / Level ideal
- Subgroup type
- Component ideal
- Elliptic points
- Cusp resolutions
- Elliptic point resolutions
- Hodge number
- Holomorphic Euler char
- Self-intersection K^2
- Euler number: rename as topological Euler char?
- Kodaira dimension

Search:

- Check that the suggested entries all make some kind of sense (e.g., have valid results)

Displaying results:

- Add more columns to display: Field, Level, Group type, number of cusps, number of elliptic points, Holomorphic euler char, Kodaira dimension
- Actually add all columns; the above could just be a default selection
- Add knowls

HMS pages:

- Knowls: type, component, Hodge numbers, rename Arithmetic genus to Holomorphic euler char, write "Self-intersection numbers in resolution cycles"; 
- Display more data: generator of component and level ideals, total length of resolutions, order of elliptic points, topological Euler char, resolution cycles for elliptic points
- Picture of Hodge diamond
- Fix brackets for Kodaira dimension

Properties on right hand side:

- Quadratic field
- Level norm
- Group type
- Holomorphic Euler characteristic
- Kodaira dimension
- Picture: Hodge diamond, other ideas
- Related objects: Hilbert modular forms, RM field, Fq points, Genus 2 curves with RM (at least for HMS of trivial level)

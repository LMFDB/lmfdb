# TODO: Make better upload script, so I don't have to piecemeal it together anymore

#1) Take BelyiDB files and turn it into a data files for galmaps and passports. Currently this file (magma_to_lmfdb.m) is in the BelyiDB repo in code/database_code/lmfdb_upload. It should probably be moved here, to the scripts/belyi directory of the LMFDB

#2) Throw out the galmaps entries with bad Galois orbit data, if those aren't already filtered out in the above script

#3) Compute primitivizations using the primitive-belyi-maps repo.

#4) Compute plane equations using the Gm-Reduce repo.

# This describes the process needed to introduce into the LMFDB data
# coming from Tim Dokchitser on Artin representations.

# For importing artin into mongodb (execute from the import_scripts/ folder)
python import_generic.py artin_file.json limbo.artinXXX

# For importing nfgal into mongodb (execute from the import_scripts/ folder)
python import_generic.py nfgal_file.json limbo.nfgalXXX

Then, need to change the first line of lmfdb/databases/Dokchitser_databases.py to match the information above limbo.artinXXX and limbo.nfgalXXX

# For linking to the number field database:
# This adds a "label" field to every entry in the number field galois groups database, given by the label used in John Jones' nf database
# It does that by computing the polredabs of the polynomial supplied by Tim
# Most of the time, this polynomial is already the polredabs, so some time is wasted there. But that's not always the case.
# (execute from the import_scripts/artin_representations_Dokchitser/ folder)
python link_number_field_to_number_field_galois_group.py

# Adding conductor length into conductor_plus field of artin rep, for searching
# (execute from the import_scripts/artin_representations_Dokchitser/ folder)
python inject_conductor_len.py 

# From a sage -sh, in the main lmfdb folder, run the following to create indices:
>>> import lmfdb
>>> lmfdb.artin_representations.main.initialize_indices()

# Update the knowl artin.database_comment (accessible at http://www.lmfdb.org/ArtinRepresentation/ )
# to reflect the new reality.

Adding new fields to the lmfdb involves computing more data for them,
managing labels, and then importing them.

Fields are represented in the form [polynomial in x, [list of ramified primes]]
Polynomials should always be run through polredabs first

To add new fields, we only process fields of a given degree one at a time
  - optionally, dump existing fields by running dump_alldeg.py which creates
    files p-alldeg-n where 1<n<48. Then remove any existing fields from your
    list (so save the time it takes to reprocess them)
  - run them through gp with prep.gp.  The main function is doall1 which is
    takes as input a list of pairs [polynomial in x, [list of ramfied primes]]
    Save the result in a file, referred to below as newstuff.prep
  - dump labels with python using dump-label-data.py which dumps files 
    called label-data-k where k is the degree.  This command takes as an 
    optional argument a list of degrees to dump, otherwise it does them all
  - make labels for the new ones (here k is the degree of the fields)
      make-labels.py label-data-k newstuff.prep
    which creates the file newstuff.prep.out
    This command also fills in some fields to make the import step easier
  - add the new stuff with
      import_nf_data-new.py newstuff.prep.out
